ðŸ’¥ I crash when playing on a server

Crashes are fairly often related to a server-specific issue. To make sure your crash isn't related to a specific server, it is advised to join the FiveM.net testing server. If that server works without your issue, we recommend you to contact the server owners of the server where you're experiencing crashes on. Otherwise, read on
Then Run FiveFix

First of all deactivate your antivirus ( windows defender )

Close the game completely, it is suggested to end the task from Task Manager

Run FIVEFIX.EXE PRESS CLEAR CACHE Once done

Now we have to delete the caches.xml file, to do that first go to the below path
Username Folder > AppData > Local > FiveM > FiveM Application Data
STEP 3. Alternatively, Right Click on the FiveM application Shortcut, from the context menu choose Open folder Location
STEP 4. Now locate the Cache.xml file
STEP 5. Once you have found the file, right-click on it and Delete the file
